Make a smaller wp-signup in the top of your site, that works for wpms, allowing website registration and even integrated with "New blog templates" wpmudev plugin

== Description ==

If you want a smaller wp-signup in the top of your site, that works for wpms, allowing website registration and even integrated with "New blog templates" wpmudev plugin, this is your plugin.
You could do this with a custom-signup.php like a template for your theme too, so this is more useful for people that doesn`t have FTP access.
The integration with "New blog templates" is only to make your templates appear since the first step of you registration form, because it has 3 steps and the default is make your templates appear only in the second step.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is missing on this plugin? =

It helps people that doesn`t have FTP access, but I don`t think it is the best solution for people that have it. 
Maybe an AJAX solution could be better.
It has not settings panel in the backend
Probably you will have to fix some css problems for you own theme. It is all right for Limitless theme http://themeforest.net/item/limitless-multipurpose-drag-n-drop-theme/5528738
Maybe you will need to set some css for the errors too.
